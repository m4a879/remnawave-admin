"""License-token storage for installed plugins.

Plugins read their JWT through :func:`get_token` rather than the env var
directly so that a single panel can host several licensed plugins without
polluting the process environment.

Lookup order on the plugin side:

1. ``RWA_LICENSE_KEY`` env (legacy single-plugin installs, dev mode)
2. ``plugin_licenses`` row for the plugin id (the UI installer)

Either source is enough; the env wins to keep development workflows
deterministic.
