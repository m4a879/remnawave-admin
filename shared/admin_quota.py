"""Admin quota counter updates — shared between bot and web backend.

Centralizes the logic for incrementing/decrementing admin usage counters
(users_created, traffic_used_bytes, nodes_created, hosts_created) so
bot and web backend do not duplicate this logic.

Counter model:
- users_created / nodes_created / hosts_created: lifetime change
  counters. Incremented on every create AND on every delete (a tick
  per "change"). The number only ever grows. Useful for tracking
  activity, not for hard limits.
- traffic_used_bytes: the total traffic the admin is responsible for.
  Equals `sum of (limit + used)` across all quota events to date.
  Conceptually: the admin is "charged" for the limits they've
  allocated AND for the traffic their users have consumed. The
  consumed portion is irrecoverable — only the unused portion is
  returned to the admin on delete or on limit-decrease edits.
    * Create user with limit L: +L
    * Reset user traffic (used was U): +U. The U is now on the admin's
      tab because the user got a do-over on their fresh quota.
    * Edit user from L1 to L2 (used < L2): -(L1 - L2). Only the
      decrease is returned. The consumed traffic up to L1 stays on
      the tab.
    * Delete user (limit L, used U): -unused where unused = max(0, L - U).
      The consumed U is NOT returned — it stays on the tab forever.
    * Reassign (with previous owner): old -unused, new +unused
    * Reassign (no previous owner): new +full_limit

All counter updates go through increment_usage_counter (from shared.rbac),
which floors the result at 0 to prevent the negative-value bug from
inconsistent create/edit tracking.

    `used_traffic_bytes` MUST be the amount the user had used

    Counter model — `traffic_used_bytes` = sum of (limit + used) of all
    quota events to date, conceptually "the total traffic the admin is
    responsible for":

    - Create user with limit L: the (L, 0) event adds L to the counter.
    - User uses X traffic: we don't update the counter at use time (we
      don't know about it), but the consumed X is implicitly part of

    - Reset user (used was U): the (0, U) event is recorded. The user
      now has fresh quota, but the U they had consumed stays on the
      admin's tab — it can't be recovered even by deleting the user.
      This is why reset adds U to the counter.

      (L1 - L2) is returned. The consumed traffic up to L1 is still
